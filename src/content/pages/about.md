So it looks like you have stumbled upon my blog. Welcome! I hope you
will find something interesting on it. Feel free to share or comment
(I don't have in-page comments yet, but you can use Twitter or Mastodon
and mention [me](https://mastodon.social/@fidel)).

If you want to know more details about me including contact
information you can visit my [home page](https://fidelramos.net).

This being my personal blog I will write about my passions, hobbies
and stuff I discover and want to share. Some of the [regular
topics](/categories#categories) I plan on writing about:

* [Programming / Free Software / Software Engineering / Computer stuff in general](/categories/software)
* Economics / Politics
* Cryptocurrencies and decentralized technologies
* Photography

I feel that social media is not only shortening our attention span,
which is bad enough, but also it makes it difficult to properly
articulate arguments. In this regard another goal of this blog is to
expose ideas and opinions in a long form.

I try to write most articles in both English and Spanish. Since I'm
the author they won't always be a literal translation, I might reword
things to carry the point across better. Also I reserve the right to
write in only one language if the topic is only relevant to some
public or if I don't find time to translate.
