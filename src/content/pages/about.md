It looks like you have stumbled upon my blog.
Welcome!
I hope you will find something interesting.
Feel free to share or comment, I love hearing from readers.
You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ampajaro) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@fidel).

If you want to know more details about me including contact information you can visit my [home page](https://fidelramos.net).

This being my personal blog I will write about my passions, hobbies and stuff I discover and want to share.
Some of the [regular topics](/categories#categories) I plan on writing about:

* [Personal stuff](/categories/personal) and reflections on life.
* [Programming / Free Software / Software Engineering / Computer stuff in general](/categories/software).
* Economics / Politics.
* [Cryptocurrencies](/categories/cryptocurrency) and decentralized technologies.
* [Photography](/categories/photography).

I feel that social media is not only shortening our attention span, which is bad enough, but also it makes it difficult to properly articulate arguments.
In this regard another goal of this blog is to expose ideas and opinions in long form.

I try to write most articles in both English and Spanish.
Since I'm the author they won't always be a literal translation, I might reword things to carry the point across better.
Also I reserve the right to write in only one language if the topic is only relevant to some public or if I don't find time to translate.
